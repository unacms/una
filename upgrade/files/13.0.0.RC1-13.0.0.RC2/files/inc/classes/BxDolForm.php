/**
 * Forms allows to display forms from data stored in DB tables, before it was possible to display forms from PHP arrays only.
 *
 *
 * The Form Objects have the following main advantages:
 * - Minimal coding is needed to create different forms
 * - Easy forms alterations
 * - Multiple representations of the same form
 * - Automated data inserting into database
 * - Automated data updating
 * - Automated data checking
 * - Automatic security checking
 * - Automatic spam filter
 *
 *
 * Forms API uses several definitions:
 * - Form or Form Object - record in sys_objects_form table, or instance of Form class.
 * - Form Display - set of some form inputs in particular order, displayed for some purpose; one form can have several displays, for example add and edit displays.
 * - Form Input or Form Field - form input field, like textarea, checkbox or set of radio buttons.
 *
 *
 * @section form_creating_object Creating the Form Object
 *
 * 1. Create Form Object, add record to sys_objects_form table:
 * - object - name of the Form Object, in the format: vendor prefix, underscore, module prefix, underscore, internal identifier or nothing; for example: bx_group - for group data processing, like group adding or editing.
 * - title - Form Object title to display in studio forms builder.
 * - action - url to submit form to, if url is not full and not empty, then site url is added automatically.
 * - form_attrs - serialized array of additional form attributes.
 * - submit_name - name of form field with submit button, it is used to determine if form is submitted.
 * - table - DB table name (for automatic saving/updating).
 * - key - DB table field with unique ID (for automatic updating).
 * - uri - DB table field with URI (for automatic URI generation, aling with uri_title).
 * - uri_title - DB table field with data title (for automatic URI generation, aling with uri).
 * - params - serialized array of additional form parameters:
 * - checker_helper - name of custom BxDolFormCheckerHelper class.
 * - csrf - array of Cross-site request forgery attack prevention parameters, for now only one boolean parameter is supported - disabled, so it can be disabled for particular form.
 * - active - 1 or 0, if form is inactive then it can not be used anywhere.

 *
 * 2. Create Form Displays, add records to sys_form_displays table:
 * - display_name - name of the Form Display, in the format:
 *                  form object name, underscore, internal identifier or nothing;
 *                  for example: bx_group_add - for displaying group adding form, bx_group_edit - for displaying group editing form
 * - module - module name this display belongs to, it must be associated with name field in sys_modules table.

 *
 * @section form_using_own_class Using own class for custom behavior
 *
 * It is possible to provide own class for displaying and processing the form.
 * To do this you need to point it in override_class_name and override_class_file fields in sys_objects_form table.
 * Your custom class must be inherited from BxTemplFormView class or its descendants.
 *
 *
 * @section form_display_custom_control Displaying custom field control
 *
 * It is possible to leave form field with default caption and override only the form field control.
 * To override some field you need to define the following function:
 * @code
 *      protected function genCustomInput[field name] ($aInput).
 * @endcode
 * Where [field name] is form field name.
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 *     protected function genCustomInputCustom ($aInput) {
 *         return
 *         'r: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][0]) ? $aInput['value'][0] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />' .
 *         'g: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][1]) ? $aInput['value'][1] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />' .
 *         'b: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][2]) ? $aInput['value'][2] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />';
 *     }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section form_display_custom_row Displaying custom field row
 *
 * Form row consists of caption and control, by default it is displayed with default design and functionality.
 * If you need to display some field with custom header and control you need to declare the following function:
 * @code
 *      protected function genCustomRow[field name] ($aInput).
 * @endcode
 * Where [field name] is form field name.
 *
 *
 * @section example Example of usage
 *
 * Printing the form for adding new record to the database:
 *
 * @code
 *      $oForm = BxDolForm::getObjectInstance('sample_form_objects', 'sample_form_objects_add'); // get form instance for specified form object and display
 *      if (!$oForm)
 *          die('"sample_form_objects_add" form object or "sample_form_objects_add" display is not defined');
 *      $oForm->initChecker(); // init form checker witout any data - adding new record
 *      if ($oForm->isSubmittedAndValid())
 *          echo 'inserted id: ' . $oForm->insert (); // add new record to the database
 *      echo $oForm->getCode(); // display form
 * @endcode
 *
 * Printing the form for editing existing record in the database:
 *
 * @code
 *      // $iEditId - ID of edited row, for example from _GET parameter
 *      $oDb = BxDolDb::getInstance();
 *      $sQuery = $oDb->prepare("SELECT * FROM `sample_input_types` WHERE id = ?", $iEditId);
 *      $aRecord = $oDb->getRow();
 *      if (!$aRecord)
 *          die("$iEditId record wasn't found.");
 *
 *      $oForm = BxDolForm::getObjectInstance('sample_form_objects', 'sample_form_objects_edit'); // get form instance for specified form object and display
 *      if (!$oForm)
 *          die('"sample_form_objects_edit" form object or "sample_form_objects_edit" display is not defined');
 *      $oForm->initChecker($aRecord); // init form checker with edited data
 *      if ($oForm->isSubmittedAndValid())
 *          echo 'updated: ' . $oForm->update ($iEditId); // update database
 *      echo $oForm->getCode(); // display form
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example of custom form class and custom checking helper class:
 *
 * @code
 *      class BxSampleForm extends BxTemplFormView {
 *
 *          public function __construct ($aInfo, $oTemplate = false) {
 *              parent::__construct ($aInfo, $oTemplate);
 *          }
 *
 *
 *          // display input with 'custom' name
 *          protected function genCustomInputCustom ($aInput) {
 *              return
 *              'r: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][0]) ? $aInput['value'][0] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />' .
 *              'g: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][1]) ? $aInput['value'][1] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />' .
 *              'b: <input type="text" size="2" value="'.(isset($aInput['value'][2]) ? $aInput['value'][2] : '').'" name="'.$aInput['name'].'[]" />';
 *          }
 *
 *      }
 *
 *      class BxSampleFormCheckerHelper extends BxDolFormCheckerHelper {
 *
 *          protected $_sDiv = ',';
 *
 *          // prepare RBG values to save to the DB
 *          function passRgb ($s) {
 *              if (!is_array($s))
 *                  return false;
 *
 *              $sRet = '';
 *              foreach ($s as $k => $v)
 *                  $sRet .= (int)trim($v) . $this->_sDiv;
 *
 *              return trim($sRet, $this->_sDiv);
 *          }
 *
 *          // prepare RGB values to output to the screen
 *          function displayRgb ($s) {
 *              return explode($this->_sDiv, $s);
 *          }
 *      }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The recommended way is to define forms in database, if it is impossible for some reasons you can init form object from array, there is an example:
 *
 * @code
 *      $aForm = array(
 *            'form_attrs' => array(
 *                'name'     => 'form_my',
 *                'method'   => 'post',
 *            ),
 *
 *            'params' => array (
 *                'db' => array(
 *                    'table' => 'table_name', // table name
 *                    'key' => 'ID', // key field name
 *                    'uri' => 'EntryUri', // uri field name
 *                    'uri_title' => 'Title', // title field to generate uri from
 *                    'submit_name' => 'submit_form', // some filed name with non empty value to determine if the for was submitted,
 *                                                       in most cases it is submit button name
 *                ),
 *                'csrf' => array(
 *                      'disable' => true, //if it wasn't set or has some other value then CSRF checking is enabled for current form, take a look at sys_security_form_token_enable to disable CSRF checking completely.
 *                )
 *              ),
 *
 *            'inputs' => array(
 *
 *                'Title' => array(
 *                    'type' => 'text',
 *                    'name' => 'Title', // the same as key and database field name
 *                    'caption' => 'Some caption',
 *                    'required' => true,
 *
 *                    // checker params
 *                    'checker' => array (

 *                        'params' => array(3,100),
 *                        'error' => 'length must be from 3 to 100 characters',
 *                    ),
 *                    // database params
 *                    'db' => array (
 *                        'pass' => 'Xss',  // do XSS clear before getting this value, see BxDolFormCheckerHelper class for all pass* functions
 *                    ),
 *                ),
 *
 *                'Description' => array(
 *                    'type' => 'textarea',
 *                    'name' => 'Description', // the same as key and database field name
 *                    'caption' => 'Some caption',
 *                    'required' => true,
 *
 *                    // checker params
 *                    'checker' => array (
 *                        'func' => 'length',
 *                        'error' => 'enter at least 3 characters',
 *                        'params' => array(3,64000),
 *                    ),
 *                    'db' => array (
 *                        'pass' => 'XssHtml',  // do XSS clear, but keep HTML before getting this value
 *                    ),
 *                ),
 *            );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Using of above array:
 *
 * @code
 *        $oForm = new BxTemplFormView ($aForm);
 *        $oForm->initChecker();
 *
 *        if ($oForm->isSubmittedAndValid ()) {
